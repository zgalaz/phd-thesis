# Ph.D. Thesis
Hi there, my name is [Zoltan Galaz](http://zoltan.galaz.eu/) (zoltan@galaz.eu), and this is my Ph.D. thesis named 
"Analysis of motor and non-motor deficits in patients with Parkinson’s disease based on the acoustic analysis of 
dysarthric speech" ([official webpage](https://dspace.vutbr.cz/handle/11012/137115?locale-attribute=en)). I defended 
this thesis in december, 2018 at the [Brno University of Technology](https://www.vutbr.cz/en/), Czech Republic. 

## Abstract
Hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) is a speech disorder occurring in up to 90% of patients suffering from idiopathic 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) that significantly contributes to unnaturalness and incomprehensibility of speech of these 
patients. The main aim of this doctoral thesis is to investigate possibilities of using quantitative para-clinical 
analysis of HD, employing speech parametrization, statistical analyses, and machine learning techniques, for diagnosis 
and remote objective assessment of PD. This thesis demonstrates that it is possible to use computerized acoustic 
analysis to sufficiently describe HD, especially dysprosody, which is characterized by flat speech melody and 
unnatural speech rate. Moreover, it demonstrates it is also possible to use robust clinically interpretable acoustic 
parameters quantifying various manifestations of HD, such as phonation, articulation, and prosody, to assess the 
severity of motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. Next, it presents the investigation of pathophysiological mechanisms 
shared by HD and freezing of gait in PD. And finally, it proves it is also possible to accurately estimate the change 
in gait-related deficits in the horizon of two years using acoustic analysis at the baseline.
